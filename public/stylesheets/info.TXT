Build a script in PHP/JS/PYTHON to get information from Zillow.com:

Run for each of the locations: 
*. Essex County, NJ
*. Union County, NJ
*. Hudson County, NJ
*. Bergen County, NJ

Filter options:
* Property type: Houses, Apartments, condos and townhouses
* Days on Zillow: 1 Day
* For Sale properties (with all sub-options checked EXCEPT for "Foreclosure")

After getting the properties on the result set, we need to:
* Get the "For Sale" price number
* Get the "Rent Zestimate" number
* Get the most updated "Property taxes" number - This is usually presented on the page for a few years back, we only need the latest.
   See Tax History Here (we only care about the top line [2013]) - NOTE: does not exist for each property - IGNORE ones without it
   http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/243-Old-Chester-Rd-Essex-Fells-NJ-07021/69527478_zpid/

On a nightly basis the above properties should be processed and the process needs to present:
A list of properties that have the following ratio higher than X. (X can be configurable).
       Ratio = ("Rent Zestimate" * 12 - "Property Taxes") / "For Sale" Price  

The list should show:
* The Ratio (%)
* The price of the property
* The town the property is at
* The link to the property page
